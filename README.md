## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing Airbnb listings in San Diego using data from 2019. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns related to rental prices, host activities, and neighborhood trends through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning. This analysis helps understand the factors influencing Airbnb performance in San Diego, a popular travel destination.

## The Scope of this Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data science that involves understanding data through visualizations and descriptive statistics. This project focuses on enhancing EDA skills by applying various techniques to the San Diego Airbnb dataset. Additionally, the project explores machine learning models to predict rental prices and analyze key features.

## Source of the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [San Diego Airbnb Listings, 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/san-diego-airbnb-listings-august-2019) dataset available on Kaggle. It contains detailed information about Airbnb listings in San Diego, including prices, location, and host details.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda:** For data analysis and coding.
- **Google Colab:** For accessing and analyzing the dataset using Kaggle's API.
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees).
  - `xgboost`: Advanced gradient boosting model.

## Implementation Details

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
   - The dataset is loaded using pandas and initially cleaned to handle missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted visualizations to understand data distributions, correlations, and patterns using matplotlib and seaborn.
   - Analyzed key features influencing Airbnb prices and availability.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implemented various models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict rental prices and classify listings based on their features.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, mean squared error, and r-squared score.
